Fine-grained vehicle classification from MEASURED physical size.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The COCO class head does not work from 70 m looking down. Measured on the Level 1
run, across 69,505 detections the model's own per-frame labels were:

    car 63,931 | truck 2,565 | pedestrian 1,625 | motorcycle 817 | bus 567

92% of every detection came back "car". Per-track majority voting was NOT the
problem - median vote purity was 1.00, i.e. the model was confidently and
consistently wrong. YOLO was trained on ground-level photographs where a bus is a
tall slab of windows; from directly above it is a long rectangle, which is out of
distribution, and the class head collapses onto its dominant prior.

So we stop asking the network for the fine-grained answer and measure the vehicle
instead. Telemetry gives a calibrated ground plane, so size is available in real
metres - and length-based classification is how traffic engineering has always
done this (FHWA and similar schemes classify by length and axle count, not by
appearance).

How the dimensions are recovered
--------------------------------
YOLO gives an AXIS-ALIGNED box, so its width is not the vehicle's width - it is a
mixture of length and width that depends on which way the vehicle is pointing. For
a vehicle of ground length L and width W at image heading phi:

    footprint_m = L*|cos phi| + W*|sin phi|      (ground-projected bottom edge)
    depth_m     = L*|sin phi| + W*|cos phi|      (ground-projected vertical extent)

Two equations, two unknowns, solved per observation:

    det = cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) = cos(2*phi)

The solve degenerates at phi = 45 and 135 degrees, where the box is square and
carries no orientation information, so those observations are discarded
(|cos 2phi| < 0.35) rather than fitted. Each track then takes the MEDIAN over its
surviving observations, which is robust to per-frame box jitter.

What the numbers do and do not mean
-----------------------------------
`depth_m` is the box's far edge projected onto the road plane. For a tall vehicle
that lands beyond the real bodywork, because the roof is not on the ground - so
measured length is biased UPWARDS with vehicle height, by roughly
height * tan(27 deg) at this gimbal angle. We do not correct for it (we cannot
measure height from one view) and we do not hide it: the thresholds below were
calibrated against the measured distribution on this footage, not copied from a
vehicle catalogue, and every row carries the measurement that produced its label.
