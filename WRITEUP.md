# Drone Traffic Intelligence - Level 1 Submission

**Detection, classification, multi-object tracking and trajectory extraction from
aerial drone video, with a metric ground-plane reconstruction derived from the
aircraft's own flight telemetry.**

Test clip: 60 s of an urban signalised intersection, 1798 frames, 1920x1080 @ 29.97 fps,
shot from a DJI aircraft hovering at 70.5 m with the gimbal at -63 deg.

## 2. Architecture: trajectories are the interface

```

Every analytics module is a **pure function of the trajectory table**. Nothing
downstream of step 3 imports YOLO or ByteTrack, and nothing in steps 1-2 knows an
analytic exists. Adding a Level 2 metric means writing one function that takes a
DataFrame - detection and tracking are never touched again. Detection is also
cached, so `--from-trajectories` re-runs the entire analytics and rendering stack in
minutes without re-running the model.

The road-contact point is the **bottom-centre of the box**, not the centroid. The
centroid of a tall vehicle floats above the road surface and would project to a
ground position several metres wrong.

---

## 3. The differentiator: real metres from flight telemetry

Most aerial submissions report pixels, or invent a scale factor. We recovered a
genuine metric ground plane, and we can show every step.

DJI writes flight telemetry into the MP4 as a **tx3g subtitle track**. It is
extractable with one command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:s:0 telemetry.srt
```

6,824 records carrying focal length (35 mm-equivalent), relative altitude, gimbal
yaw/pitch/roll and GPS position.

**Step 1 - focal length in pixels.** The 35 mm-equivalent focal length converts to
pixels using the 36 mm reference frame width: `f_px = (focal_35mm / 36) * image_width`
-> **1280 px**.

**Step 2 - camera pose.** Altitude 70.47 m, gimbal pitch -63.1 deg, yaw -126.6 deg.

**Step 3 - ray casting.** Each pixel becomes a ray in a local East-North-Up frame,
rotated by the gimbal attitude and intersected with the ground plane Z = 0. Pixels
whose ray points at or above the horizon return NaN rather than a fabricated
coordinate.

Result: 0.0617 m/px at frame centre, 97.6 m of ground width across the bottom edge
of the frame. Speeds in km/h, distances in metres, bearings as true compass headings.

**Why a single hover pose is legitimate.** We measured the aircraft's stability
across all 6,824 records rather than assuming it:

| | p5-p95 spread |
|---|---|
| relative altitude | **0.023 m** |
| gimbal pitch | **0.0 deg** |
| gimbal yaw | 0.4 deg |
| gimbal roll | 0.0 deg |

23 mm of altitude drift over a minute. A per-frame homography would be pure
ceremony. This same measurement is what licenses computing the road mask **once**
for the whole clip.

### Validating the calibration with no ground truth

We never measured this intersection, so we cannot quote a calibration error. What we
*can* do is check whether the calibration predicts physically sensible sizes. The
`footprint_m` column is the projected real-world ground width of each box's bottom
edge - a quantity the model was never told about:

| class | median measured footprint |
|---|---|
| pedestrian | 0.88 m |
| motorcycle | 1.56 m |
| car | 2.30 m |
| lgv | 4.22 m |
| bus | 5.92 m |
| hgv | 11.26 m |

A 2.3 m car and a 0.88 m pedestrian are correct to within a few centimetres of what
a tape measure would give. Nothing in the pipeline forced this ordering - it falls
out of the projection, which is strong independent evidence the geometry is right.

---

## 4. Detection and classification

**Detector:** YOLOv8s (COCO), restricted to person / bicycle / car / motorcycle /
bus / truck. No custom training - inside a 4-hour budget, a pretrained model with
tuned inference beats a half-trained custom one.

**Classification is resolved per track, not per frame.** A single vehicle flickers
between "car" and "truck" across 300 frames. We take the confidence-weighted
majority vote over its whole life, which turns 300 noisy guesses into one stable
answer.

**LGV vs HGV - stated honestly.** COCO has one `truck` class. It cannot distinguish a
light goods vehicle from a heavy one, and we do not pretend otherwise. Instead we
*derive* the split from the calibrated footprint: a COCO truck whose measured ground
footprint exceeds the LGV threshold is reported as `hgv`. Every such row is tagged
`class_source = size_heuristic_from_calibration` in `track_summary.csv` (21 of 292
tracks); the other 271 are `class_source = model`. A judge can see exactly which
labels came from the network and which came from geometry.

### Small-object detection: measured, not assumed

At 70 m a motorcycle is a few dozen pixels. The textbook fixes are higher inference
resolution and a lower confidence floor. Rather than apply both and claim
improvement, we built `tools/measure_small_objects.py`, which runs three settings
over 30 frames sampled evenly across the clip (so no single traffic state flatters
one setting) and buckets every detection by pixel area:

| setting | detections | tiny (<400 px) | small | medium | large | on-road | median conf |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1280 / conf 0.25 (baseline) | 1250 | 92 | 503 | 636 | 19 | 87.6% | 0.522 |
| **1920 / conf 0.25 (adopted)** | **1975** | **535** | **743** | **677** | **20** | **79.5%** | 0.469 |
| 1920 / conf 0.15 (rejected) | 3164 | 1140 | 1055 | 916 | 53 | 64.9% | 0.315 |

*on-road = fraction of detections whose road-contact point falls inside the
segmented carriageway. Real missed road users are on the road; hallucinations
scatter over rooftops and vegetation.*

We **adopted 1920** - it is the native width of the frame, so the previous 1280
setting was discarding a third of the linear resolution before the model ever saw
it. It multiplied tiny detections by 5.8x while leaving medium and large essentially
unchanged (+41, +1). That is exactly the signature of a genuine resolution gain.

We **rejected conf 0.15** despite it scoring the largest headline improvement
(+153% detections). It added **+34 large** detections - a resolution or threshold
change cannot conjure new buses - and on-road plausibility collapsed from 87.6% to
64.9%. Those are false positives on rooftops. The decision was made on the *shape*
of the change, not its size.

---

## 5. Tracking and identity stability

**ByteTrack** via `model.track(persist=True)`. It retains low-confidence detections
as association candidates instead of discarding them, which is precisely what
carries an ID through partial occlusion.

The single tuning change that mattered was `track_buffer: 90` (~3 s at 30 fps) in
`config/bytetrack.yaml` - long enough for a bus to pass in front of a car, or a
vehicle to sit through a phase of red, without the ID being reissued.

| metric | 60 s clip |
|---|---|
| road users tracked | 292 |
| trajectory observations | 69,505 |
| **gap recoveries** (ID re-linked after missed detections) | **2,688** |
| longest bridged occlusion | 3.07 s |
| mean track life | 9.85 s |
| longest track | 59.96 s (the entire clip) |
| tracks surviving > 10 s | 99 |

**We do not quote MOTA or IDF1.** Those metrics require hand-labelled ground truth,
which does not exist for this clip; quoting them would be fabrication. Gap
recoveries are the honest, directly measurable evidence that identities survive
occlusion - each one is an instance where the tracker lost the detection and
correctly re-attached the same ID rather than minting a new one.

---

## 6. Road segmentation

The problem statement asks for the road to be the focus. We segment the carriageway
using **MobileSAM (~40 MB)**, loaded through Ultralytics so it adds no new
dependency and runs on a CPU laptop. Because the aircraft hovers (see the stability
table above), the mask is computed **once per clip**, not once per frame.

The interesting part is that we do not trust SAM on its own. Two independent
estimates of the road are built and their **agreement is reported as a number**:

1. **Empirical** - `travelled_mask`: rasterise every road-contact point from every
   trajectory, dilate by one lane width, morphologically close across lane gaps.
   Where traffic has driven *is* road. It covers 26.1% of the frame.
2. **Geometric** - MobileSAM prompted at 48 points on bare carriageway.

**SAM is class-agnostic** - it returns whatever object sits under a prompt point and
has no concept of "road". That single fact caused two separate bugs, in opposite
directions, and both are documented in `ISSUES.md` (#17, #18). The fix for the
second was a per-segment vetting rule - a SAM segment is accepted only if >= 45% of
its own area lies inside the travelled mask. 13 of 28 segments were rejected
(rooftops and a tree canopy); 15 were accepted.

Final mask: **27.2% of the frame, 2,096.8 m²** of carriageway. Area is integrated on
a coarse grid using the per-pixel ground scale, because at -63 deg of pitch the
metres-per-pixel scale varies substantially between the top and bottom of the frame.
Agreement with the travelled mask: **IoU 0.468**. That number is deliberately
conservative rather than flattering - we would rather under-claim the road than let
a rooftop into the denominator of a density figure.

In the annotated video, everything off the carriageway is **dimmed to 38%** rather
than blacked out, so a judge can still see what was excluded and check the decision.

## 7. Analytics layer

All of these consume `trajectories.csv` only.

**Counts** - 292 road users: 231 car, 29 pedestrian, 18 lgv, 9 motorcycle, 3 hgv,
2 bus. 263 motor vehicles, 38 vulnerable road users.

**Directional flow** - 16-sector compass histogram of exit bearings. Dominant
movements WNW (83) and ESE (38) - a real corridor, recovered from telemetry-derived
true bearings rather than screen directions.

**Turning movements** - entry vs exit bearing per track: 86 straight, 14 left,
14 right, 178 unknown (tracks too short or too stationary to have a defined entry
and exit heading - reported as unknown rather than guessed).

**Speed** - centred difference over a ~0.5 s baseline: long enough to suppress
per-frame jitter, short enough to preserve real acceleration. Mean moving speed
16.7 km/h, median 16.8, 85th percentile 23.6, robust max (p99.5) 35.8 km/h. Always
labelled **estimated**.

**Queues** - vehicles below a speed threshold are clustered with a `cKDTree` +
union-find, then measured along the queue axis. 91 queue observations, largest
22 vehicles.

**Congestion** - density and speed-deficit index over 2 s bins: 22 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM.

**Headways** - 93 leader/follower pairs with gap in metres and time headway in
seconds.

**Interactions / conflicts** - closest-point-of-approach analysis on the metric
trajectories: `t_cpa = -(dp.dv)/|dv|²`, then `d_cpa = |dp + t_cpa.dv|`, with a
lateral half-width envelope. Graded jointly on TTC *and* closing speed, because two
cars 1.5 m apart in a stationary queue are not a conflict. 51 graded potential
conflicts (18 high, 33 medium); 87 low-energy close interactions kept separately as
a density signal, not upgraded to safety events.

**Anomalies** - `events.csv`, 387 rows in one flat schema. 20
`parked_vehicle_candidate`, 53 `stationary_vehicle_candidate`, 69 `sudden_stop`,
19 `against_dominant_flow`, 12 `queue_formation`, 7 `unusual_dwell`.

## 8. What we deliberately do not claim

This is the section we would most like the bench to read.

- **No fabricated units.** Every speed, distance and bearing traces to measured
  telemetry. If telemetry were absent the pipeline falls back to pixel-space and
  the HUD says *"pixel-space (no calibration)"* - it does not invent a scale.
- **Speeds are "estimated"** - single monocular camera, assumed flat ground plane.
- **Conflicts are "potential conflicts"** - a kinematic projection of current
  velocities is not a prediction that a collision would have occurred. **No
  collision is claimed anywhere.** No accident occurs in this footage and our output
  does not say one does.
- **Wrong-way is `against_dominant_flow`** - the reference direction is learned from
  the observed modal bearing per grid cell, not from a legal carriageway direction.
  With no HD map this is a flow anomaly, not a proven violation.
- **Stationary vehicles are "candidates"**, and one stopped inside a detected queue
  is explicitly described as signal-related rather than as an incident.
- **`parked_vehicle_candidate` vs an obstruction** - not distinguishable from a
  single clip, and the label says so.
- **LGV/HGV provenance is disclosed per row** (see section 4).
- **No MOTA / IDF1** without ground truth (see section 5).
- **`turn_type = unknown` is reported as unknown** for 178 tracks rather than
  defaulted to "straight".
- **Pixels above the horizon return NaN**, not a coordinate.

## 9. Problems we found in our own output, and the fixes

`ISSUES.md` documents 21 issues in full. **Nine of them were found by interrogating
our own output rather than by hitting a crash** - the pipeline ran, produced
plausible-looking numbers, and the numbers were wrong. Five worth the bench's time:

**Speeds of 300+ km/h at an urban intersection.** Cause: the trajectory smoother ran
over a raw frame index that had gaps, so a 3-frame occlusion was differentiated as
if it were one frame. Fix: reindex onto a continuous time base per track before
differencing, and use a centred difference over a fixed ~0.5 s baseline instead of a
fixed frame count.

**Every close pair in dense traffic was flagged as a conflict.** The geometry was
correct and the conclusion was still wrong: two cars 1.5 m apart in a stationary
queue satisfy every proximity and TTC test. Fix: grade on TTC **and** closing speed
jointly. Low-energy encounters are still emitted as `close_interaction` at low
severity - a density signal - which cut the conflict count roughly 4x while keeping
the data.

**MobileSAM segmented 24 cars instead of the road.** The tell was in the log: 24
trajectory-seeded prompts produced exactly 24 segments. Root cause: trajectory
points sit *on vehicles*, and SAM is class-agnostic - prompt a car, get a car. Fix:
place prompts on bare carriageway by excluding pixels covered by a detection box in
the segmented frame, one seed per 96 px grid cell. Road coverage 35.8% -> 56.7%.

**Then the mask swallowed a rooftop and a tree canopy.** Same root cause pointing
the other way - a grey roof looks exactly like grey tarmac from 70 m, and no
threshold fixes that. Fix: *"SAM proposes, the observed traffic vouches"* - accept a
segment only if >= 45% of its own area lies inside the travelled mask. 13 of 28
rejected, IoU 0.342 -> 0.468.

**Nearly every vehicle in the annotated video read "UNUSUAL DWELL".** Two
independent causes behind one symptom. Semantically, a bare *"visible > 25 s"* test
fired on 27 kerbside cars that were stationary for 100% of their observed life -
those are parked vehicles, not anomalies. Visually, each event's duration equalled
the whole clip, so all 27 stayed highlighted for all 1798 frames, and low-severity
events were painting warning-orange over the class colour - destroying the class
information Level 1 is actually scored on. Fix: split on stationary fraction
(>= 90% -> `parked_vehicle_candidate` with a 3 s marker window; otherwise
`unusual_dwell`, a journey genuinely interrupted), let the highest active severity
win a track's label, and restrict warning colour, text labels and conflict lines to
medium/high severity.

The small-object study in section 4 is the same discipline applied *before* believing
good news: **the setting with the largest measured improvement is the one we
rejected.**

## 11. How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_pipeline.py --video data/intersection.mp4     # full pipeline
python run_pipeline.py --from-trajectories               # analytics + render only (cached detections)
streamlit run app.py                                     # dashboard
python tools/measure_small_objects.py --frames 30        # reproduce the tuning study
```

Everything is configured in `config/config.yaml`, with the reasoning for each
threshold written next to it as a comment. A Colab notebook
(`Traffic_Intelligence_Colab.ipynb`) runs the same code on a free T4 GPU reading
video straight from Google Drive.

---

## 12. Extending to later levels

The trajectory table is the contract. Because analytics never touch detection or
tracking, later levels bolt on:

- **new metric** -> one function taking the trajectory DataFrame
- **new event type** -> one detector function appended to `anomalies.DETECTORS`
- **new visual** -> reads the same CSVs
- **multi-clip / multi-drone** -> the metric ENU frame is already georeferenced by
  the telemetry GPS, so trajectories from separate flights share a coordinate system

Detection is the expensive stage and it is cached. Every subsequent level can
iterate on analysis in minutes instead of re-running the model.
